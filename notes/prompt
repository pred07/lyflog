SYNAPSE — Enhancement Plan (v1 → v1.5)
PART A — FIX WHAT IS CURRENTLY BROKEN (PRIORITY)
1️⃣ Custom States MUST Appear on Dashboard (Non-Negotiable)

Current problem

Users add custom states

They disappear unless you go to Trends

This breaks trust immediately

Fix (Conceptual)

Dashboard should show:

Top 3 most-logged custom states

Same visual weight as Sleep / Workout

If user adds “Anxiety” or “Energy” → it appears automatically

Rule

If a user defines something, the system must acknowledge it visibly.

2️⃣ Dashboard Needs a “What Am I Looking At?” Layer

Right now the dashboard looks pretty but not self-explanatory.

Add a quiet explanation layer (not tutorial).

Example (small text, once):

“This view shows recent patterns.
Reference lines indicate your recent baseline.”

This removes 70% confusion.

PART B — RESTRUCTURE DASHBOARD (MORE, BUT ORGANIZED)
3️⃣ Dashboard Sections (Clear Mental Model)

Instead of “one long graph page”, split visually:

🔹 Section 1 — Overview (Top)

Last updated time

Days logged (e.g., “23 days of data”)

One sentence:

“Patterns emerge over time. Daily variation is expected.”

No buttons. No actions.

🔹 Section 2 — Core Metrics (Universal)

Always present:

Sleep

Movement (Workout)

Meditation

Learning

These are biological / behavioral fundamentals.

🔹 Section 3 — Personal States

Auto-generated from user:

Anxiety

Focus

Energy

Any custom state

Shown only if user logs them.

🔹 Section 4 — Exposures (NEW, VERY IMPORTANT)

This is where cigarettes, alcohol, porn, etc. go.

PART C — ADD “EXPOSURES” (SAFE WAY)
4️⃣ Create a Separate Category: Exposures

DO NOT mix these with habits or states.

Exposures = inputs that affect the system

Examples:

Cigarettes (count)

Alcohol (units)

Porn / sexual stimulation (duration)

Drugs (yes/no, duration)

Late-night screen time

Rules (STRICT)

Always opt-in

Hidden by default

No labels like “bad”, “addiction”, “relapse”

No goals

No warnings

Dashboard shows:

frequency

timing

correlation only

Example text:

“Exposure frequency over time”

5️⃣ Correlation View: Exposure ↔ State ↔ Sleep

This is where WOW comes from.

Examples:

Cigarettes ↔ Sleep

Alcohol ↔ Anxiety

Porn ↔ Focus

Drugs ↔ Energy variability

Displayed as:

scatter plots

overlays

neutral text:

“Observed association. Not causation.”

NO advice.

PART D — UNIVERSAL vs PERSONAL (VERY IMPORTANT SPLIT)
6️⃣ Two Metric Classes (Make This Explicit)
Universal Metrics (Biological)

Sleep

Movement

Diet (basic)

Meditation

Learning (offline)

These are always available.

Personal Metrics (User-Defined)

Anxiety

Horniness

Motivation

Social battery

Creativity

These are user-owned.

Never mix them in labels or colors.

PART E — FIX TEST / DEMO EXPERIENCE (CRITICAL)
7️⃣ Demo Dashboard Must Teach Usage

Your test users (admin, test) must show:

At least:

2 custom states

1 exposure

1 universal metric

Visible correlations

Missing days

No “perfect improvement”

Add a banner:

“Example data to illustrate patterns.
Your data will replace this.”

Remove after first real log.

PART F — THEME & POLISH ISSUES
8️⃣ Automatic Theme Switching (Fix Scope)

Allowed:

System dark/light sync

Manual override

Not allowed:

Theme changes based on mood or data

Why:

Mood-based UI = emotional manipulation

Breaks neutrality

PART G — WHAT YOU MUST NOT ADD (READ THIS TWICE)

❌ Happiness index
❌ Life percentage lived
❌ Health score
❌ Addiction labels
❌ Recovery counters
❌ Push notifications
❌ Advice cards

These will destroy trust with vulnerable users.

FINAL PRODUCT NORTH STAR (DO NOT LOSE THIS)

SYNAPSE is not a dashboard of self-control.
It is a record of cause and effect.

If a feature answers:

“Am I doing well?”

Reject it.

If it answers:

“What tends to happen when X is present?”

It belongs.

PRIORITY ORDER (DO THIS IN SEQUENCE)

Custom states visible on dashboard

Exposure category (separate)

Dashboard sectioning

Demo dashboard clarity

Correlation depth

Theme consistency
