SYNAPSE — “Logbook” / Sheet Feature (Design Plan)
0️⃣ First: Name It Correctly (Important)

❌ Do NOT call it:

Productivity sheet

Planner

Task tracker

Habit tracker

✅ Call it:

Logbook

Daily Record

Session Log

Activity Sheet

This keeps it observational, not evaluative.

1️⃣ Why This Feature Belongs (When Is It Used?)

This feature is for:

structured activities (gym, study, rehab, practice)

sessions with details

things that don’t fit sliders or charts

Examples:

Chest day workout details

Study topics covered

Practice sessions

Therapy homework (optional)

It is not for daily life mood.

2️⃣ Core Principle (Non-Negotiable)

The Logbook records sessions.
The Dashboard shows patterns.
The Logbook never scores performance.

If you keep this rule, you’re safe.

3️⃣ Logbook Structure (Excel-Like, but Controlled)
Each Logbook Is User-Defined

User creates a Logbook like:

“Gym Training”

“Math Study”

“Meditation Practice”

“Skill Practice”

Each Logbook has:

Custom columns

Custom data types

Optional checkboxes

Optional remarks

4️⃣ Supported Field Types (This Is the Key)

Allow only these field types:

✅ Field Types

Text (e.g., exercise name, topic)

Number (e.g., weight, reps, duration)

Checkbox (✔ / ✖)

Select (Chest / Back / Legs)

Notes (free text)

❌ Do NOT allow:

Auto-calculated scores

Completion percentages

Rankings

5️⃣ Example: Gym Logbook (Your Case)

Logbook: Gym Training

Date	Exercise	Weight (kg)	Reps	Set	Done	Notes
12 Aug	Bench Press	15	12	1	✔	Warm-up
12 Aug	Bench Press	20	11	2	✔	Stable
12 Aug	Incline DB	12	10	1	✖	Fatigue

Rules:

✔ means performed, not “success”

✖ means skipped, not “failure”

Notes are context only

6️⃣ Example: Study Logbook

Logbook: Math Study

Date	Topic	Studied	Notes
13 Aug	Integration	✔	Need revision
13 Aug	Limits	✖	Skipped
14 Aug	Differentiation	✔	Understood basics

Again:

✔ = happened

✖ = didn’t happen

No score

7️⃣ Where This Appears in the App
Navigation Placement

Add one tab only:

Logbook

Do NOT mix it into Dashboard.

8️⃣ How Analysis Works (Very Important)
Allowed Analysis (Safe)

From Logbooks, SYNAPSE may show:

Frequency (sessions per week)

Distribution (which exercises/topics appear most)

Gaps (days with no entries)

Time clustering (e.g., evenings vs mornings)

Language:

“Recorded sessions”

“Observed frequency”

“Common entries”

Forbidden Analysis

❌ “Improved performance”
❌ “Strength increased”
❌ “Study efficiency”
❌ “Completion rate”
❌ “Progress score”

The app must never evaluate skill or growth.

9️⃣ Weekly / Monthly Views (Allowed)
Weekly View

Rows grouped by week

Counts only (e.g., “4 gym sessions recorded”)

Monthly View

Heatmap of presence, not quality

Neutral color scale

No “best week” labels.

🔟 Relationship With Other Data (Powerful but Safe)

Logbook entries can be correlated, not judged.

Examples:

Gym sessions ↔ Sleep

Study sessions ↔ Focus

Training days ↔ Energy variability

Shown as:

overlays

scatter plots

neutral text

1️⃣1️⃣ Customization Rules (Critical)

User can:

Create/delete logbooks

Add/remove columns

Choose checkbox vs number

Rename fields

System must:

Never auto-add fields

Never assume meaning

Never normalize values

1️⃣2️⃣ UX Guardrails (Prevent Overwhelm)

Default: no logbooks

User must explicitly create one

Max 1–2 active logbooks recommended

Empty state message:

“Use logbooks only when detail helps.”

This protects users from over-tracking.

FINAL SANITY CHECK

Ask this before shipping:

Can a user use this logbook without ever feeling judged, measured, or behind?

If yes → ship
If no → simplify

FINAL SUMMARY

This Logbook feature:

Adds serious power

Supports gym, study, practice

Feels like Excel without Excel’s pressure

Fits SYNAPSE’s philosophy if isolated correctly
