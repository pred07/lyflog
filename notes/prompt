How to Use NYTVND LifeLog

NYTVND LifeLog is not something you work on.
It is something you glance at.

There is no right way to use it.

1. Start Simple

You do not need to log everything.

On most days, logging one or two things is enough.

Examples:

Just sleep

Just workout

Just a note

Incomplete data is normal.
Missing days are normal.

Nothing breaks if you skip.

2. Log What Happened, Not What You Think

Log facts, not explanations.

✅ “Slept 5.5 hours”
❌ “Bad sleep”

✅ “No workout”
❌ “Lazy day”

This keeps the data honest and useful.

3. Don’t Look for Improvement

This app does not measure progress the way other apps do.

There are:

No scores

No streaks

No achievements

Instead, look for:

repetition

fluctuation

stability

change over time

Clarity comes from weeks, not days.

4. Use the Dashboard Like a Weather Report

The dashboard is not feedback.
It is a snapshot.

Ask questions like:

“Is this week different from last week?”

“What seems consistent?”

“What varies the most?”

Do not ask:

“Am I doing well?”

“Is this good or bad?”

The app will never answer those.

5. Patterns Take Time

Meaningful patterns usually appear after:

~7 days: rhythm

~14 days: variation

~30 days: baseline

Until then, everything looks noisy.

Noise is not failure.

6. Notes Are Context, Not Journals

Notes are optional.

Use them only to record:

unusual days

external events

things you might forget later

Examples:

“Late work call”

“Travel day”

“High stress meeting”

You don’t need to write feelings unless you want to.

7. This Is Not Therapy

NYTVND LifeLog does not:

diagnose

treat

advise

fix

If you’re already seeing a professional, this app can sit alongside, not replace, that support.

8. You Control the Data

At any time, you can:

export all data

delete everything

stop using the app

There is no penalty for leaving.

If you no longer need it, it has done its job.

9. If You Feel Stuck

If you’re unsure what to do:

log less

look less often

simplify

The app works best when it stays quiet.

Final Reminder

This app exists to reduce confusion, not to create pressure.

If it ever feels demanding, step back.
