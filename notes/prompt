NYTVND LifeLog (Test Auth Version)

Build a science-first LifeLog web application called NYTVND LifeLog (Night Wind Operations – Life Observatory).

This is not a productivity app, not a self-help app, and not a gamified tracker.
The goal is personal observability — enabling users to see patterns in their own behavior without advice, scores, or judgment.

1. Core Principles (Non-Negotiable)

No XP, streaks, badges, scores, or rankings

No “you should” or improvement advice

No moral language (good/bad, healthy/unhealthy)

Data is displayed neutrally

User derives meaning independently

Privacy-first mindset

2. Tech Stack (Strict)

Frontend: React (Next.js preferred)

Backend: Firebase

Firestore for data

Firebase Hosting

Authentication (TEMPORARY):

Test username + password only

Stored securely (hashed)

Clearly marked as development auth

Charts: Recharts or Chart.js

Design: minimal, data-first UI, dark & light mode

⚠️ Important:
Auth layer must be abstracted so Google SSO can replace it later without touching business logic.

3. Pre-Login Landing Page (Public)

Create a public landing page before login.

Landing Page Sections
Hero

Headline:
“See what your life is actually doing.”

Subtext:
“NYTVND LifeLog is a personal observatory. No advice. No gamification. Just patterns.”

CTA buttons:

“How It Works”

“Login (Test Mode)”

How It Works

9. Architecture Notes (IMPORTANT)

Auth logic isolated from app logic

Firestore schema designed for:

user

daily_logs

metrics

No hard dependency on auth provider

Ready for Google SSO replacement later

10. End Goal

The app should feel like:

“A scientific instrument for observing one human life.”

Not:

A coach

A judge

A habit enforcer

A belief system

Output Expectation

Clean, modular codebase

Test auth functional

Neutral dashboards implemented

Firebase integrated

SSO-ready architecture

No gamification leakage
