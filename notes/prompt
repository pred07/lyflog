SYNAPSE — Enhancement Plan

(Clarity-first, mobile-first, science-safe)

PHASE 1 — CLARITY & UX REFINEMENT (Highest Priority)
Goal

Make SYNAPSE instantly understandable and effortless to use, especially for stressed users.

Enhancements
1️⃣ Home = Dashboard (Single Mental Model)

Treat Dashboard as Home

Remove the feeling of “multiple sections”

Users should never wonder where to go

Rule:
If it’s used daily → it belongs on Home.

2️⃣ Mobile-First Navigation (Android-like)

Bottom navigation with 4 icons max:

Home

Log

Trends

Me (Profile)

No menus inside menus.

3️⃣ Profile Personalization (Light, Non-Emotional)

Add:

Display name

Simple symbol/icon (not avatars, not photos)

Theme preference

Why:
Identity grounding without emotional pressure.

PHASE 2 — PERSONAL STATES (Your Big Upgrade)
Goal

Allow personalized tracking (happiness, calm, energy, etc.) without scoring or judgment.

4️⃣ User-Defined States (Optional)

During onboarding or settings, let users:

Select predefined states (Energy, Calm, Focus)

Rename them

Add custom states (e.g., “contentment”, “restlessness”)

Rules

States are self-defined

Logged on a simple 1–5 scale

No labels on numbers

Entirely optional

5️⃣ Redefine “Happiness” Safely

SYNAPSE never uses the word “happiness”

Users may choose it as a personal label

System treats it as a neutral state

Displayed as:

Variability

Range

Distribution

Never as:

Score

Trend up/down

Improvement

PHASE 3 — PATTERN DEPTH (Without Advice)
Goal

Increase “wow” through insight, not features.

6️⃣ Variance & Baselines (Silent Progress)

Enhance dashboards to show:

Variance bands

Baseline emergence after ~20–30 days

Stability vs fluctuation

Progress = clarity over time

No numbers that say “better”.

7️⃣ Correlation Context (Education, Not Suggestion)

In Trends:

Keep correlations

Add one-line scientific context

Example:

“Sleep is known to influence nervous system regulation.”

Never:

“You should sleep more.”

PHASE 4 — ONBOARDING & DEMO EXPERIENCE
Goal

Remove confusion in the first 60 seconds.

8️⃣ First-Login Demo Dashboard

Show 21–30 days of imperfect demo data

Clearly labeled:

“Example data to illustrate patterns.”

Automatically disappears after first real log

9️⃣ One-Screen Usage Guide

A short in-app guide with rules like:

Log less, not more

Missing days are fine

Look weekly, not daily

This reduces anxiety immediately.

PHASE 5 — TRUST & ETHICS (Quiet but Important)
Goal

Make SYNAPSE feel safe and adult.

🔟 Principles / Ethics Page

Add a simple page explaining:

No scoring

No recommendations

No selling data

User-owned data

Not therapy

This builds credibility.

PHASE 6 — WHAT TO DELAY (DO NOT ADD YET)

These are tempting but harmful at this stage:

❌ Life percentage lived
❌ Happiness index
❌ Weight / BMI
❌ Overall scores
❌ Notifications
❌ Social comparison
❌ “Goals” or “targets”

Delay them indefinitely unless proven safe.

FINAL NORTH STAR (DO NOT LOSE THIS)

SYNAPSE exists to reduce confusion, not to optimize life.

If a feature:

creates pressure

invites comparison

implies success/failure

It does not belong.

PRIORITY ORDER (If You Do Nothing Else)

Mobile-first simplification

User-defined states

Variance/baseline visualization

Demo dashboard

Profile personalization

Do these five, and SYNAPSE becomes distinct and credible.
