SYNAPSE — Dual Dashboard System (Final Design)
Core Insight (This Solves the Confusion)

Not all tracking happens in the same mindset.

Before gym → you are in action mode

During day → you are in routine mode

Later → you are in reflection mode

So SYNAPSE needs separate dashboards, not one overloaded screen.

DASHBOARD TYPE 1 — SESSION DASHBOARD

(Used before gym / study / practice)

Purpose

Fast, focused, operational.
This is what you open before doing something.

📍 When it’s used

Before going to the gym

Before starting a study session

Before practice

What it shows (ONLY this)
Header

Today’s date

Practice name (e.g., Gym Training)

Workout / Session Builder (Live)

You:

Select session type
→ Chest & Triceps

Add exercises (free text or from history)

Bench Press

Chest Press

Triceps Extension

For each exercise:

Add sets dynamically

Enter:

Weight

Reps

✔ / ✖ per set

Optional note (“PR for me”)

Example (live view):

Bench Press
Set 1: 20 × 12 ✔
Set 2: 25 × 10 ✔
Set 3: 80 × 8 ✔

[ + Add Set ]

Rules

No charts

No history comparisons

No feedback

Just recording what happens

This is a live notebook, not a dashboard.

DASHBOARD TYPE 2 — HABIT CALENDAR DASHBOARD

(Used daily for routines & habits)

Purpose

Quick daily marking.
This is what you open once or twice a day.

📍 When it’s used

Morning / night

Checking routines

Tracking multiple habits

Layout (Distinct from Session)
Top: Today

Date

“Mark what happened today”

Habit Sets (Grouped)

Example:

Morning Routine

[✔] Meditation

[✖] Reading

Health

[✔] Gym

[✔] Walk

Study

[✖] Maths

[✔] Revision

Calendar View (Weekly / Monthly)

Below habits:

Weekly grid (✔ / ✖ only)

Tap a date → edit marks + notes

Rules

✔ = happened

✖ = didn’t happen

No streaks

No scores

No pressure

This is presence tracking, not performance.

DASHBOARD TYPE 3 — OBSERVATION DASHBOARD

(Reflection, not action)

This is your existing /dashboard.

Purpose

Understanding patterns after time passes.

What it shows
Sections

Overview

Days logged

Baseline visible message

Core Metrics

Movement

Meditation

Learning

Personal States

Anxiety

Energy

Focus

Exposures

Caffeine

Screen time

What it never shows

HOW ALL THREE WORK TOGETHER (IMPORTANT)
Example Day

Before gym

Open Session Dashboard

Log chest & triceps

Close app

During day

Open Habit Calendar

Mark gym ✔

Mark study ✖

Later / weekly

Open Observation Dashboard

See how gym days relate to sleep & energy

Each dashboard has one job.

HOW NEW HABITS ARE ADDED (Your Use Case)
Adding a new habit

Go to Habit Calendar

Tap “Add Habit”

Enter name (e.g., “Cold Shower”)

Assign to a Habit Set

Start marking ✔ / ✖ daily

No setup complexity.

WHY THIS FEELS “NEXT LEVEL”

Gym logging feels like a real training log

Habits feel lightweight, not demanding

Dashboard feels analytical, not judgmental

No screen tries to do everything

This is professional-grade UX.

ONE RULE TO ENFORCE EVERYWHERE

Action screens must never judge.
Reflection screens must never instruct.

If you keep this, SYNAPSE stays unique.

FINAL SUMMARY

You now have:

Session Dashboard → detailed, live, gym/study

Habit Calendar Dashboard → daily routines, multiple habits

Observation Dashboard → patterns & analysis

Each is distinct.
