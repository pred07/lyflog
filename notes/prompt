🔹 SYNAPSE — Landing Page Refinement Prompt (Concept Only)

Refine the SYNAPSE landing page to communicate clarity, scientific intent, and calm confidence within 10–15 seconds of reading.

Core goals:

Instantly explain what SYNAPSE is and why it exists

Filter for users who prefer understanding over motivation

Reduce anxiety, pressure, and cognitive load

Avoid feature overload or marketing tone

Constraints (must follow):

No hype language, no promises, no productivity claims

No motivational framing, goals, or “improve your life” messaging

No advice, predictions, or future-oriented claims

Tone must be neutral, observational, and adult

Required improvements:

Above-the-Fold Clarity

Clearly state that SYNAPSE helps users observe patterns in daily life (sleep, habits, focus, stress)

Emphasize “mirror, not mentor” immediately

Make “No scores. No streaks. No advice.” visually secondary but unmistakable

System Explanation (Why, Not Just What)

Explain why Action and Reflection are separated

Frame this separation as reducing anxiety and self-judgment

Use scientific, non-emotional language

Mode Descriptions

Ensure each mode explains what it intentionally does not do

Avoid causal or outcome-based phrasing (“affects”, “improves”)

Replace with association-based language (“tend to move together”)

Audience Framing

Describe users in neutral terms (transition, disruption, high load)

Avoid emotionally charged or identity-based language

Make it clear this is not therapy, coaching, or productivity software

Anti-Features as Trust Signals

Highlight what SYNAPSE deliberately avoids

Add explicit statement that the system does not predict, rank, or recommend

Frame absence of pressure as a design decision, not a limitation

CTA Tone Adjustment

Replace action-heavy CTAs with low-pressure language

Emphasize exploration over commitment

Clearly state demo requires no account

Visual & Copy Tone

Calm, minimal, restrained

No urgency cues, no bright contrast, no emotional triggers

Language should feel like documentation, not marketing

Success criterion:
A first-time visitor should leave thinking:

“This system won’t judge me or push me — it will help me see.”
